This is the infamous game brought to popularity with the TV show The Big Bang Theory.                                                                                                                    The logic:
Scissors cuts Paper.
Paper covers Rock.
Rock crushes Lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock.
Spock smashes Scissors.
Scissors decapitate Lizard.
Lizard eats Paper.
Paper disproves Spock.
Spock vaporizes Rock.
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.
